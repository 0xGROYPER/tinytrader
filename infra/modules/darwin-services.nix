# tinytrader.services.<name> on macOS (nix-darwin): the same definitions as
# on NixOS (service-options.nix), run as the host's primary user, so a service
# sees the drives that user attaches.
#
# Each service is com.tinytrader.<name>, restarted when it exits (at most
# every 10 s), logging to ~/Library/Logs/tinytrader/<name>.log. The system's
# newsyslog rotates those logs past 10 MB, keeping 7. Its `launchd` option
# says how it starts:
#
#   "agent" (the default)  a launchd agent (launchd.user.agents, in
#                          ~/Library/LaunchAgents): started when the user
#                          logs in, in the gui/<uid> domain
#   "daemon"               a launchd daemon (launchd.daemons, in
#                          /Library/LaunchDaemons) with UserName set to the
#                          primary user: started at boot without anyone
#                          logging in, in the system domain. With FileVault
#                          on, boot still waits for the disk to be unlocked
#                          at the login window (no full login needed after).
#
# A daemon runs as the user but outside their login session: it gets HOME
# and USER (set here), not the user's keychain or GUI. Switching a service
# from agent to daemon, activation boots out the still-running agent first
# (nix-darwin removes the agent's plist but can't unload it from the user's
# session), so the two never run at once.
#
# launchd has no sandbox or memory limits like systemd's: `writablePaths`
# and `resources` other than `openFiles` apply on Linux only.
