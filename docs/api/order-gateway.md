# Order gateway (`tinytrader.gateway/1`)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | One broker account behind a small order protocol: validation, caps, a kill switch, a hash-chained journal and lossless resume. Strategies are its clients. |
| **Transport** | TCP, one JSON object per line (NDJSON), on loopback (`--listen`). |
| **Versioning** | `"schema": "tinytrader.gateway/1"` on every message, both directions. Any other schema (including `tinytrader.gateway/2`, which is not defined yet) is refused with `error{schema_unsupported}` ([section 2](#2-framing-and-versioning)). |
| **Auth** | Per-client bearer tokens in `hello`, from a mode-600 file or `env:VAR` (`VAR` or `VAR_FILE`), with a role and an order-id prefix ([section 4](#4-authentication-and-roles)). |
| **Errors** | `type:"error"` (fatal, then close) or `response.outcome` (`error`, `not_sent`, `rejected`, `unknown`) with a `code` or `reason` ([section 12](#12-error-codes)). |
| **Health** | `welcome.state` and `status` events (`reconciling`, `ready`, `degraded`, `killed`), and heartbeats carrying `last_seq`. The gateway serves no HTTP observe endpoints yet ([decision 0017](../decisions/0017-client-contracts.md)). |
| **Stability** | **Stable.** Server messages may gain fields and new `kind`/`event` values within v1; requests are strict. |

Shared conventions are in the [API overview](README.md). How to write a client is in the [strategy client tutorial](../tutorials/strategy-client.md). Items marked **UNVERIFIED** are broker behaviors a paper qualification must still capture.

`order-gateway` is a broker-access passthrough. It handles authentication, validation, forwarding, correlation, event delivery and mechanical safety. It has no strategy, no portfolio and no planning. Clients own their strategy, sizing, positions and P&L; the broker is the authority for order state.

## 1. Process and account model

- **One process per broker account.** `order-gateway` runs in the `services/order-gateway` package. Each process serves exactly one account, holds only that account's credentials, and owns the single `trade_updates` connection that account is allowed.
  - Several accounts mean several processes, for example `paper-a` on port 7601 and `paper-b` on 7602.
  - Each process runs in its own tmux session or supervisor unit.
- **Broker kinds:** `alpaca-paper`, `alpaca-live` (only with `--allow-live`) and `sim` (see [section 10](#10-simulated-broker)).
  - Both implement one synchronous `Broker` seam.
  - The process selects one of them through an enum. There are no plugins.
- **Independence:**
  - The process does not need feed, relay, replay or the data gateway to run.
  - The one exception is the simulated broker in market mode, which reads a quote source that the operator names.
- **Library use:** the same library can be embedded in-process, for example a backtest driving `SimBroker` directly.

The inputs (the full syntax is in [Running `order-gateway`](#running-order-gateway)):

| Input | Example | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| account name | `--account paper-a` | Gateway-local name. |
| broker kind | `--broker alpaca\|sim` | Selects the enum arm. |
| environment | `--environment paper` | Selects a compiled endpoint pair. There is no URL flag. `live` comes with `--broker alpaca-live`, which is refused without `--allow-live`. |
| credentials | `--credentials env`, or `--credentials-file FILE` | `env`: `APCA_API_KEY_ID` and `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`, each from the environment or a `*_FILE` (a Docker secret), decrypted by sops at launch. A file: mode 600, not a symlink, `APCA_*` or `ALPACA_*` names. Values are never logged. |
| listen | `--listen 127.0.0.1:7601` | Must be a loopback address; anything else is refused, unless `--listen-any`, which is only for a container whose port is published on loopback. |
| state root | `--state /var/lib/order-gateway/paper-a` | Holds the journal ([section 11](#11-order-journal)). It must not be under `/tmp`, nor under any `--forbid-state-under DIR` the deployment names (a scratch or bulk-data volume, say). |
| clients | `--client NAME,ROLE,PREFIX,TOKEN` (repeatable; `TOKEN` is a mode-600 file or `env:VAR`) | See [section 4](#4-authentication-and-roles). |
| profile | `--max-open 4 --budget 150 …` | Caps and allowlist ([section 8](#8-rate-budget-and-caps)). |

### Identities

| Identity | Assigned by | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `account` | operator | Binds the broker kind, environment, credential file and profile. |
| `client` | operator | A name and a token, bound to one account, with one role and one `client_order_id` prefix (such as `strat-`). |
| `client_order_id` | client | Mandatory. It is the **only logical order key**: 1 to 128 characters from `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`, starting with the client's prefix. It is unique per account for as long as the journal reserves it (30 days), and is never reused, even after a rejection or an `absent_after` result. |
| `request_id` | client | Correlates one request with its response. 1 to 64 characters, unique within a connection. |
| `broker_order_id` | broker | Kept exactly as received (an Alpaca UUID). `cancel` and `order` accept it as well as `client_order_id`. |
| `seq` | gateway | Per account, starting at 1, monotonic and gap-free in the journal. It never resets across days or restarts. |

There is no gateway `order_id` and no separate `command_id`. The broker is the authority for order state.

## 2. Framing and versioning

- **Transport:** TCP on loopback.
- **Framing:** each message is one UTF-8 JSON object on one line, terminated by `\n`.
  - The maximum line is 65,536 bytes, including the newline.
  - JSON whitespace outside strings is allowed but never contains a newline.
- **Schema field:** every message in both directions carries `"schema":"tinytrader.gateway/1"` and a `type`. Sketches in sections 3 to 12 leave out `schema` to save space; the worked examples in [section 13](#13-worked-examples) show it.
- **Strictness:**
  - Requests from clients are strict: an unknown field, a missing field or a wrong JSON type is refused.
  - Messages from the server may gain fields within v1, and clients must ignore fields they do not know.
  - A new `event` value or `kind` is additive. A client that sees an unknown value must keep the line and not fail.
- **Value encodings:**
  - Prices are decimal strings, such as `"1.25"` or `"-0.40"`.
  - Quantities and ratios are JSON integers.
  - Timestamps are integer nanoseconds since the Unix epoch, UTC. They exceed 2^53, so JavaScript clients must parse them as BigInt.
- **`broker_raw`:** the broker's JSON value, embedded as a JSON value.
  - Key order, string contents and number lexemes are preserved.
  - Only whitespace outside strings is removed, which is needed for line framing.
  - Clients can parse it exactly as they parse Alpaca responses today.
- **Breaking changes** ship as `tinytrader.gateway/2`, served alongside `/1` for an announced overlap period. They are recorded on this page.

## 3. Connection lifecycle

```text
C→S hello      {client, token, resume_after_seq: N | null, cancel_on_disconnect?: false}
S→C welcome    {account, broker, environment, state, last_seq, resume, capabilities, pins, limits}
S→C event …    replayed journal suffix (seq > N, visible to this client), then live events
C→S request …  S→C response …   (interleaved with events, in production order)
S↔C heartbeat  {ts, last_seq}   after 10 s without sending; a peer silent for 30 s is closed
S→C error      {code, message}  fatal errors close the connection after sending
```

- **Hello:**
  - `hello` must be the first line and must arrive within 5 s.
  - The token is compared in constant time.
  - A wrong token, or a client bound to a different account, gets `error{unauthorized}` and the connection closes.
  - The process has no general unauthenticated phase. A client must authenticate even to run `clock`.
- **`welcome.state`:** one of `reconciling`, `ready`, `degraded` or `killed`.
  - `capabilities` gives the shapes, the maximum number of legs, the tick rule, the `client_order_id` length, whether the broker supports client ids (`idempotency: "broker_client_id"`), and the events the broker can produce.
  - `pins` identifies the broker build, the profile hash and, for the simulator, the reproducibility pin from [section 10](#10-simulated-broker).
- **`welcome.resume`:**
  - `full`: every requested event follows.
  - `truncated{first_available_seq}`: the requested seq is older than the resume window, so the client must reconcile through queries.
  - `none`: `resume_after_seq` was null and only live events follow.
- **Ordering:**
  - Each connection has one writer thread that drains a bounded queue (4 MiB by default).
  - Responses and events go out in the order the account session produced them.
  - A `submit` response always precedes every event for that order.
- **Slow consumers:**
  - If the queue overflows, the gateway sends `error{slow_consumer}` and closes the connection.
  - Nothing is lost: the client reconnects with `resume_after_seq` and the journal replays the suffix. This is a deliberate difference from the market-data relay.
- **Responses are not replayed.** Every outcome a client needs after a reconnect is also a journaled event (`submit`, `cancel`). A client that lost its connection before reading a response recovers the outcome from the replay.
- **Heartbeats** carry `last_seq`, so an idle client can confirm it is caught up.

## 4. Authentication and roles

- **Token files:**
  - Each client has a token file, for example `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tinytrader/gateway-clients/<client>.token`, or a container secret named by `env:VAR` with `VAR_FILE`.
  - The file is mode 600, not a symlink, and holds 32 or more random bytes encoded as hex.
  - The operator creates token files (`openssl rand -hex 32`); clients only read their own.
  - A process loads only the tokens bound to its own account.
  - Tokens never appear in logs, the journal or errors.

| Role | Allowed |
|---|---|
| `trade` | `submit` and `cancel` for ids with its own prefix, plus every query. It sees its own orders and account-wide events. |
| `observe` | Every query and every event on the account. It cannot submit or cancel. |
| `admin` | Everything `observe` can do, plus `kill`, `unkill`, `clear_order`, and `cancel` of any order. |

- A request outside the client's role gets `response{outcome:"error", code:"forbidden"}`.
- Access to the market-data relay grants no access to orders. They are separate processes, ports and tokens.

## 5. Requests and responses

Every request has the form `{type, request_id, …}`. Every response is `{type:"response", request_id, op, outcome, …}`.

| `type` | Fields | Roles | Response `outcome` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `submit` | `intent` ([section 6](#6-order-intent)) | trade | `accepted`, `rejected`, `not_sent`, `duplicate` or `unknown` |
| `cancel` | `client_order_id` or `broker_order_id` | trade (own prefix), admin | `accepted`, `rejected`, `not_sent` or `unknown`. The terminal state arrives later as an event. |
| `order` | `client_order_id` or `broker_order_id` | all | `ok{order: Order \| null}` or `error` |
| `open_orders` | — | all | `ok{orders: [Order], unresolved: integer}` (nested legs; `unresolved` is described below) |
| `account` | — | all | `ok{account: {status, cash, buying_power, options_trading_level, blocked}}` |
| `positions` | — | all | `ok{positions: [{symbol, qty (signed integer), avg_entry_price}]}` |
| `activities` | `types: [..]`, `after?`, `page_token?` | all | `ok{items: [raw], next_page_token}`, one bounded page |
| `clock` | — | all | `ok{clock: {ts, is_open, next_open, next_close}}` |
| `calendar` | `start`, `end` (dates) | all | `ok{days: [{date, open, close}]}`, with times in America/New_York |
| `kill` | `level: halt_opens \| halt_all`, `reason` | admin | `ok{state}` |
| `unkill` | `reason` | admin | `ok{state}` |
| `flatten` | `reason` | admin | `ok{state, positions: [{symbol, status, broker_raw}], broker_raw}`, or `rejected` / `unknown` ([section 9](#9-safety-rules)) |
| `clear_order` | `client_order_id`, `reason` (non-empty) | admin | `ok{client_order_id}`, or `not_cleared{reason, detail}` with the reasons in [section 12](#12-error-codes). See item 6 of section 5. |
| `advance` | `to_ts` | trade | `ok{market_ts}`. Only for the simulator in client-clocked replay ([section 10](#10-simulated-broker)). |

- Every `ok` query response carries `ts_gateway` and `broker_raw`.
- An `Order` contains: `client_order_id`, `broker_order_id`, `status`, `filled_qty`, `avg_price`, `legs?[{symbol, filled_qty, avg_price}]`, `intent_sha256` (null for an order the gateway did not submit) and `broker_raw`.
- `unresolved` in an `open_orders` reply is the count of this account's orders that are **unknown** (the lookup failed, section 5 item 5) or **absent** and not yet settled (section 5 item 4). It is the integer the console shows as unresolved; it is zero when nothing is pending. The other fields of the reply are unchanged.

### Submit outcomes

| Outcome | Meaning | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `accepted` | The broker acknowledged the order. This is **not** a fill. | `client_order_id`, `broker_order_id`, `status`, `broker_raw` |
| `rejected` | The broker refused the order. Final. | `http_status`, `code`, `message`, `broker_raw` |
| `not_sent` | **Nothing reached the broker.** Final, and journaled. | `reason`, `detail` (see [error codes](#12-error-codes)) |
| `duplicate` | The `client_order_id` is known **and** its canonical intent is byte-identical. Nothing is sent. | `current: Order` (the last journaled state) |
| `unknown` | The request may have reached the broker. | `reason: timeout \| connection \| http_5xx \| http_429_after_send` |

A known `client_order_id` with a *different* intent is `not_sent{duplicate_conflict}`.

### Unknown outcome: never resend

1. The gateway **never resends** a submit. The `send` phase is journaled before any bytes leave, so this rule also holds across a crash or restart.
2. It looks up the `client_order_id` at +1, +2 and +4 s, using the critical budget. A lookup that the budget refuses is made on a later tick, and does not use up an offset.
3. If the order is found, it emits `resolution{outcome:"found"}` followed by the order's state as `order` events with `source: rest_reconcile`.
4. Only a 404 from the broker says the order is not there. If the last lookup is a 404, the gateway emits `resolution{outcome:"absent_after", window_ms}`.
   - This is **not** a statement that the order was never submitted.
   - The id stays reserved, and a late `trade_updates` event or a later reconciliation still correlates to it.
   - The order **stays open** until it is settled or cleared (item 6). It uses a `max_open` slot, blocks closes on its legs ([section 8](#8-rate-budget-and-caps)) and counts in `unresolved`.
   - A stream event for it settles it: a terminal state (`canceled`, `rejected`, `filled`, ... and `done_for_day` for a `day` order, see the note after item 6) stops it counting, and any other state makes it an ordinary open order.
   - A reconciliation settles it too, but only when the broker shows it: it looks the order up again, and if it is found, the order is an ordinary order from its state. A 404 never clears an absent order, however many lookups return it. It stays open and counted until a stream event or a found lookup settles it.
   - While the gateway is connected to the broker, each poll (`poll`, default 1 s) looks up one absent or unknown order again, round-robin, with the same rule as item 5 below: found settles it, and a 404 or any other failure leaves it absent. Each lookup takes a non-critical budget token first ([section 8](#8-rate-budget-and-caps)); a refused token skips that order for the poll.
   - A restart does not keep the absent state. The order comes back unknown and is looked up again, so it stays open until then.
   - What to do next is the client's decision.
5. If the last lookup fails (a timeout, a 5xx, a connection error or a 429), the gateway emits `resolution{outcome:"unresolved", window_ms}`. Nothing is known about the order, so it is **unknown**, not absent:
   - It still counts as open, so it uses a `max_open` slot, blocks closes on its legs and counts in `unresolved`.
   - A stream event for it, a reconciliation after the stream reconnects, or a restart settles it. Until then clients should treat it as `unknown`.
   - After a restart an unknown order is looked up again. A journaled `absent_after` does not restore the absent state.
   - The poll looks it up again: one lookup per poll across all unresolved orders, round-robin, one broker call each. A failed lookup is retried on the next poll, then after an interval that doubles on each failure, capped at 30 s (`RECHECK_CAP`), so each order's broker call rate is bounded. The cap decides nothing about the order. A settled order starts over. The rule is the same as an absent order: a lookup that finds it settles it from its state, whatever the state. A terminal state (`filled`, `canceled`, `rejected`, `expired` or `replaced`, and `done_for_day` for a `day` order) settles it, and the order stops counting, so it no longer blocks closes on its legs. A non-terminal state (`new`, `accepted`, `partially_filled`, `pending_new` and the like) makes it an ordinary open order. A 404 or any other failure leaves it unknown and open.
6. **Clearing an order the broker does not have.** An unresolved order is never cleared by a 404 alone, nor by time. Only two broker answers that agree clear it:
   - `clear_order` (admin only) needs an order the gateway holds that is unresolved (unknown or absent) or otherwise open. The gateway then checks the broker twice, both always: the open orders listing, and a lookup by client id. The order is cleared only when both answer and neither shows it.
   - A shown order is refused as `broker_shows_order`, with the status the broker returned, whichever check saw it. A failed check (an error, a timeout or the budget) is `broker_unreachable`, unless a check shows the order.
   - A lookup by id in a clear (below) that finds the order settles it from its state the same way, even when the clear is then refused.
   - A cleared order is not open: it no longer uses a `max_open` slot, does not block closes on its legs, and is not looked up again. Its client id stays reserved, so the same intent is `duplicate` and a different one `duplicate_conflict`. A late stream event for it still applies (the broker, not the clear, has the last word).
   - Each clear is journaled as a `cleared` event ([section 7](#7-events)), and a restart keeps the order cleared.
   - Every `clear_order` request is journaled, whether it clears or is refused, as a `clear_refused` event ([section 7](#7-events)): a request from a client that is not an admin, a request with an empty reason, and a refused clear all count. A refused request changes no state.
   - The open orders listing has no paging and is capped at 500 orders. A listing of 500 entries may hide orders, so it is `unreliable`, not `absent`: an order that the listing does not show is then not ruled out. A clear is refused as `broker_unreachable` (`detail.check: open_orders`, `detail.code: listing_full`) unless the lookup by id shows the order.
   - **Automatic clear of session orders.** A `day` or `cls` (closing-auction) order that is still unresolved after its New York trading date has passed (the journaled submit time, in `America/New_York`) is checked by the same two broker calls. If the broker shows nothing, it is cleared with requester `gateway` and reason `day_order_after_session`. If the broker shows it, or the open orders listing is full, it is left alone: it is live, or the broker cannot rule it out, and the stream or a lookup settles it. The check runs on the poll, with no timer of its own. The poll's lookup and the automatic clear take turns to go first, so neither starves the other: each falls back to the other when it has nothing due. A clear turn makes one call: the open orders listing first, and the by-id lookup on the next clear turn, with the listing kept in between. The clear is made on the two answers, as above. One order is checked at a time, round-robin. A refused budget token sends nothing and leaves the order alone, without a backoff. A refused clear backs off like a lookup, on its own schedule, so a lookup's backoff never delays a clear. An automatic refusal is not journaled.
   - Good-til-canceled and unknown time-in-force orders are never cleared automatically. The time in force is read from the intent journaled at admission (`intent.time_in_force`); a journal line without it is unknown.
   - **`done_for_day` ends a `day` order only.** The broker's `done_for_day` settles an order whose journaled time in force is `day`, in every place a state settles an order (a stream event, a found lookup, a reconcile). A good-til-canceled, closing (`cls`) or unknown-time-in-force order in `done_for_day` stays open, since the broker may still work it, so it keeps its `max_open` slot and blocks closes on its legs. `stopped` and `suspended` never settle an order. **Known gap, to revisit:** stopped and suspended keep blocking, and the operator's `clear_order` refuses them while the broker shows them, so an order the broker has stopped or suspended can stay open until the broker stops showing it.

Cancel follows the same rule. An `unknown` cancel is not repeated by the gateway. The client may send another `cancel`, which is idempotent at the broker.

## 6. Order intent

The intent is broker-neutral in its naming and closed in its content. v1 is isomorphic to Alpaca's two order shapes (single and `mleg`), so the Alpaca mapping is total and loses nothing.

```text
intent = {
  client_order_id,
  shape: "single" | "combo",
  // single:
  instrument: {class: "option", symbol: OCC} | {class: "equity", symbol: TICKER},
  side: "buy"|"sell",  effect: "open"|"close",
  // combo:
  legs: [{instrument, ratio: int ≥ 1, side, effect}]   // 2..=4 legs, distinct symbols, gcd(ratios) = 1
  qty: int ≥ 1,                 // contracts or shares; for a combo, parent units
  type: "limit" | "market",
  limit_price: decimal string,  // limit: single > 0; combo: signed net per unit, + debit, − credit, ≠ 0
  ref_price: decimal string,    // market (instead of limit_price): what the client expects it to cost, same form
  time_in_force: "day" | "cls"  // cls: the closing auction (limit-on-close), stock single limits only
}
OCC    = ^[A-Z]{1,6}\d{6}[CP]\d{8}$   (compact, spaces removed)
TICKER = ^[A-Z]{1,5}(\.[A-Z])?$       (e.g. AAPL, BRK.B)
```

**Protocol validation** always runs:
- the fields are exact for the shape
- integers are within range
- the price has at most 2 decimal places and a non-zero magnitude
- the OCC grammar holds and its date is valid
- the leg rules hold
- the id grammar and prefix are correct

**Stock orders** are single legs only: a combo with an `equity` leg is invalid. `side: sell` with `effect: open` is a short sale. Limit-on-close (`cls`) fills at the closing price if the close is within the limit; the limit keeps the per-order dollar cap meaningful and guards against a bad closing print.

**The account allowlist** comes from the operator profile:
- underlyings (`--underlyings ROOT,...`, default **none**: a gateway started without it refuses every option order, except from an `--any-underlying-client`), class `option`
- clients allowed options on any underlying (`--any-underlying-client NAME`, repeatable, default none): for a manual trading client such as the console's. Only the underlying check is skipped, and only for that client's orders; every cap and the kill switch still apply, and other clients on the account keep the list. The name must be a `trade` client. The profile in `welcome` lists them as `any_underlying_clients` when there are any.
- stocks (`--equities`, default none), and whether short sales are allowed (`--allow-short`, default no)
- shapes and maximum legs
- the caps in [section 8](#8-rate-budget-and-caps)

The broker's `capabilities` declare its tick rules, and the gateway refuses an intent the broker cannot accept with `not_sent{unsupported}`, before any I/O. Whether an instrument exists is the broker's answer and arrives as a broker reject. The gateway keeps no instrument master.

**Canonical form:** the gateway re-serializes the parsed intent with a fixed field order, no whitespace, and prices normalized to the shortest form with 2 decimal places. Its SHA-256 is `intent_sha256`, which is used for duplicate detection.

**Market orders** (`type: "market"`) are sent with no price and fill at whatever the market gives, across the spread. The gateway has no quotes of its own, so a market intent carries `ref_price`, the client's estimate of its price when sent (the console sends the natural: the ask on buys, the bid on sells). The `ref_price` doesn't bound the fill, so **a market opening is refused for every client**: a market buy-to-open or sell-to-open, option or stock, is `not_sent{market_opening_refused}` before any cap is checked, and nothing is sent. A market close is allowed and is not checked against the notional cap. Day only; no `cls`.

Market openings are refused under the notional cap for every client: the cap cannot bound a market fill, so the refusal comes first and no cap is applied to them. The console's order ticket still offers market for openings, and those orders will be refused. Fixing the ticket is left for later.

**Reserved for later versions, as allowlist additions rather than protocol changes:**
- stop and stop-limit types
- GTC, IOC and FOK
- `replace`
- index-option roots

### Alpaca mapping (v1)

| Intent | Alpaca `POST /v2/orders` body |
|---|---|
| single | `{symbol, qty, side, type:"limit", limit_price, time_in_force:"day", client_order_id, position_intent}` |
| market close (single or combo) | as above with `type:"market"` and no `limit_price`. A market opening is refused ([section 6](#6-order-intent)). |
| combo | `{order_class:"mleg", qty, type:"limit", limit_price, time_in_force:"day", client_order_id, legs:[{symbol, ratio_qty, side, position_intent}]}` |
| stock single | `{symbol, qty, side, type:"limit", limit_price, time_in_force:"day"\|"cls", client_order_id}`, with no `position_intent`: Alpaca infers opening or closing from the position |
| `side` + `effect` | `position_intent` is `buy_to_open`, `buy_to_close`, `sell_to_open` or `sell_to_close` (options) |

A close leg is checked against the orders the gateway holds for its symbol before anything is sent. If any open, unknown or absent order has that symbol, the whole intent is `not_sent{leg_pending, detail.symbols}` ([section 8](#8-rate-budget-and-caps)).

Each close leg is also checked against the broker's position for its symbol, read once before the send. A close may not exceed what is held: a sell needs at least that many shares or contracts long, a buy at least that many short. A close that does is `not_sent{close_exceeds_position}`, with `detail.symbol`, `requested_qty` (the leg's quantity: `qty`, times `ratio` for a combo leg) and `held_qty`. If the position cannot be read, the close is `not_sent{position_unknown}` (fail closed). Opens are not checked this way. A fill between the read and the send is not covered.

`qty`, `ratio_qty` and `limit_price` are sent as strings. The byte form has a fixed field order (compact JSON): a single is `{symbol, qty, side, type, limit_price, time_in_force, client_order_id, position_intent}`; an MLEG is `{order_class, qty, type, time_in_force, limit_price, client_order_id, legs:[{symbol, ratio_qty, side, position_intent}]}`. `limit_price` always has two decimal places.

## 7. Events

Each event has the envelope `{type:"event", seq, ts_gateway, account, kind, …}`. Every journal line is an event. A client receives the events visible to its role ([section 4](#4-authentication-and-roles)), so a `trade` client's view is a subsequence of the account's `seq`, and gaps in that view are expected.

| `kind` | Fields |
|---|---|
| `submit` | `client`, `request_id`, `client_order_id`, `phase: admitted \| sent \| outcome`, `intent` and `intent_sha256` (admitted only), `outcome` (outcome only, the same object as the response) |
| `cancel` | `client`, `request_id`, `target`, `phase`, `outcome` |
| `order` | `client_order_id`, `broker_order_id`, `event`, `status`, `ts_broker`, `fill?{execution_id, qty, price}`, `filled_qty`, `avg_price`, `legs?[{symbol, filled_qty, avg_price, fill?{qty, price}}]`, `position_qty?`, `reason?{code, message}`, `source: stream \| rest_reconcile \| sim`, `broker_event`, `broker_raw` |
| `resolution` | `client_order_id`, `outcome: found \| absent_after \| unresolved`, `window_ms`. `absent_after` is a 404 on the last lookup: the order is absent but stays open until a stream event or a lookup that finds it settles it; `unresolved` is a failed last lookup, and the order stays unknown until the poll, a stream event or a lookup finds it ([section 5](#unknown-outcome-never-resend)). |
| `cleared` | `client_order_id`, `requester` (the admin's client name, or `gateway` for the session-order rule), `reason`, `broker: {open_orders: {result: "absent", listed}, by_id: {result: "absent", broker_raw}}`. The two broker answers that cleared the order ([section 5](#5-requests-and-responses), item 6). Visible to the same clients as an `order` event. |
| `clear_refused` | `client_order_id` (empty when the request had none), `requester` (the requesting client's name, admin or not), `request_reason` (the reason the request gave, possibly empty), `reason` and `detail` (the `not_cleared` outcome of the refused request, [section 12](#12-error-codes)), `broker?: {open_orders: {result: shows \| unreliable \| failed \| absent, listed, status?, code?}, by_id: {result, status?, code?, broker_raw}}`, present when the broker was consulted. Visible to the same clients as a `cleared` event. Recovery ignores it: it changes no order's state. |
| `account` | `snapshot: account \| positions`, `broker_raw`. Derived from polling and emitted on change; Alpaca has no account stream. |
| `activity` | `activity_type`, `broker_raw`, for example `OPEXP`, `OPASN`, `OPEXC`, `FILL` or `FEE`. The simulator sends `OPEXP`, `OPEXC` and `OPASN` at expiry, with `broker_raw{symbol, qty (signed), price (the settlement price), date}`. |
| `status` | `state`, `broker_stream: up \| down{since}`, `resync?{from_ts, to_ts, orders_checked}`, `kill?{level, reason}`, `cap?{name}` |
| `foreign` | `broker_raw`. A broker order with no journal entry, such as one placed in the dashboard. |
| `client` | `client`, `phase: connected \| disconnected`, `resume_after_seq` |
| `day` | `day_open{format, previous_file, previous_last_hash}`. The first line of each journal file. |

**The normalized `event` vocabulary for `order`:**
- `new`, `accepted`, `pending_new`
- `partial_fill`, `fill`
- `pending_cancel`, `canceled`, `expired`, `done_for_day`, `replaced`
- `rejected`, `stopped`, `suspended`, `calculated`
- `cancel_rejected`, `replace_rejected`
- `other`

`broker_event` keeps the exact broker string, so an unknown broker event arrives as `other` with its raw string. Nothing is dropped.

**Fill fields:**
- `fill.qty` and `fill.price` are the increment for that execution.
- `filled_qty` and `avg_price` are cumulative.
- For a combo:
  - `fill.price` is the net price per unit.
  - Each element of `legs` gives that leg's cumulative quantity and average price, plus `fill` for the increment.
  - Alpaca reports an MLEG fill in `trade_updates` as **one aggregate `fill` message** for the parent: the net `price` and `qty`, no parent `execution_id`, a top-level `legs` list with each leg's price, quantity and execution id, and `position_qtys`. Seen on a paper account (a 1-lot call debit spread, opened and closed, each filled at once). Partial MLEG fills haven't been seen yet. `legs` comes from the nested `order.legs[]` in `broker_raw`.
- During reconciliation, if the broker's `execution_id` is missing, the gateway emits the aggregate change with `fill` absent. It never fabricates an execution id.

## 8. Rate budget and caps

- **Request budget:** one token bucket per account process, 150 requests/min (Alpaca allows 200/min per account), with two priorities.
  - `critical`: submit, cancel and unknown resolution.
  - `poll`: reconciliation, the account and position pollers, and client queries.
  - Polls are shed first. Each poll lookup of an unresolved order, each automatic clear check and the degraded open orders listing takes a non-critical token, which keeps 20% of the bucket for critical requests. A refused token skips the poll's call.
  - A 429 on a poll lookup sets the same backoff as any other 429. A 429 on the degraded listing blocks the broker polls for its `Retry-After`, as any other 429 does.
  - A close (a submit with no opening leg) is critical and is not held up by a 429 backoff, so it still goes when tokens are available. It still spends a token from this bucket, so the bucket bounds closes too.
- **Broker calls per tick:** the session is one thread, and a broker call blocks it (up to its 10 s timeout). So a tick makes at most one blocking broker call, whether the gate is open or closed. Its one call is the first of these that applies: a reconcile step while the gate is closed (and nothing else runs that tick); a reconcile step while a reconcile is in progress (after a stream reconnect); a poll lookup, an automatic clear check or the degraded open orders listing; a pending lookup; or, when the tick made no call, one cancel from the cancel-on-disconnect queue. A reconcile is a queue of calls: the account gate, one lookup per open order, the recent orders and the positions. It runs one call per poll, so a stream reconnect with many open orders is not a burst. Its calls take a token first: the gate and the lookups take a non-critical one (a refused token skips the call and leaves it for a later tick), and a 429 on any of them holds the budget back. The startup reconcile runs before the first request, with critical tokens, so the gate opens as soon as it can; it stops at a closed gate or a refused token, and the rest runs on ticks. A closed gate holds the startup reconcile, which retries the account call on later polls until it passes. A reconnect's reconcile, with the gate already open, is dropped when its account call fails or the account fails the gate: the poll lookups, automatic clears and degraded listing carry on, and the next reconnect starts a new reconcile. A lookup the reconcile queued is skipped when its order has settled since (from a stream event, say), and no REST answer moves a settled order (filled, canceled, expired, rejected, or a `day` order in `done_for_day`) back to a working status. A sentinel kill is the exception to the one-call rule: it cancels all open orders, lists them and cancels each one, so its tick makes as many calls as it has orders to cancel. The kill sentinel is checked at the start of each poll, before any lookup, and a kill made in a tick ends that tick's poll work, so a lookup never delays a kill. With a blackholed broker (10 s timeout, no retries) a normal, gate-closed, reconcile or cancel-on-disconnect tick blocks for at most 10 s, however many orders are unresolved. A sentinel-kill tick blocks for 20 s when the listing fails, which is the blackholed case; with a listing that answers, it blocks for 10 s per call it makes. Requests (submit, cancel, kill) wait for at most one such tick.
- **When accounts may share a limit:** if several accounts share one user-level limit (**UNVERIFIED**), the operator sets `--budget` on each process so that the total stays at or below 150.
- **On a 429:**
  - The gateway sets `blocked_until = max(Retry-After, x-ratelimit-reset, backoff)`.
  - A 429 on a POST whose bytes left the socket is `unknown{http_429_after_send}`.
  - A throttle that happens on the client side, before any send, is `not_sent{throttled}`.
  - GETs may retry with bounded backoff. POSTs and DELETEs never retry.

**Per-account caps.** These are defaults from the operator profile. They are mechanical access limits, not portfolio risk. A violation is `not_sent{cap}` with the cap's name in `detail`. The notional, open-order, submits-per-minute and submits-per-day caps apply to intents with an opening leg. An order that is absent and not yet settled still counts as an open order. An intent whose legs all close is held only to the legs and reject limits and to the closes-per-minute cap, so a position can always be closed: closes are not counted toward the opening caps, and the opening caps never refuse a close.

| Cap | Flag | Default |
|---|---|---|
| opening submits per minute | `--submits-per-min` | 60 |
| opening submits per day (UTC) | `--submits-per-day` | 500 |
| closes per minute (counted apart from the opens; `not_sent{cap}`, `closes_per_minute`) | `--closes-per-min` | 30 |
| open orders | `--max-open` | 4 |
| legs | `--max-legs` | 4 |
| maximum loss per opening intent (see above). A market opening is refused before this cap (`market_opening_refused`), so it is checked for limit openings only: the cap is named `notional` | `--max-notional` | $2,500 |
| consecutive broker rejects | `--max-rejects` | 5, which trips `halt_opens` |

**Maximum loss.** `--max-notional` caps what an opening intent can lose, not what it costs to open. The loss is per parent unit, times qty and the multiplier (100 an option, 1 a share):
- a long option or share: the premium paid.
- a naked short put: the strike less the credit.
- a combo of options on one underlying and one expiry: the net debit less the least payoff at expiry. The payoff is piecewise linear, with breakpoints at the strikes and at zero, so its least value is at one of those points. A credit is a negative debit: a $5-wide put credit spread for $1.00 loses $4.00 (the least payoff is -$5.00). A combo that keeps losing as the underlying rises (its calls sold outnumber the calls bought) is unbounded. A call butterfly, a debit condor, an iron condor and a ratio spread are all sized this way. A payoff floor above zero (a long-only combo whose payoff stays above zero at every strike) is used only for the underlyings that are American. A European root (`SPX`, `SPXW`, `XSP`, `NDX`, `NDXP`, `XND`, `RUT`, `RUTW`, `MRUT`, `DJX`, `XEO`, `VIX`, `VIXW`, `SPIKE`) is refused with `max_loss_unknown` when its floor is above zero, because its options are worth less than their intrinsic payoff before expiry; a floor at zero still loses its debit. **Any root not in this list is treated as American.** A European-style root that is not in the list must be added to `EUROPEAN_ROOTS` (`intent.rs`) before it is traded; until it is, its bound wrongly assumes American exercise.

A naked short call or a short share is refused with `max_loss_unbounded`, even with `--allow-short`, and so is a combo whose payoff falls above its highest strike. A combo with a closing leg (a roll, or an order that closes part of a position) is refused with `max_loss_unknown`: its one net limit prices every leg, and the intent gives no price per leg, so the closing legs' share cannot be read and is not assumed. A calendar or diagonal (one short and one long leg of one type, one-to-one, with the short expiring first) loses its debit when the long covers the short (a call at or below its strike, a put at or above), or its debit plus the strike gap otherwise. Every calendar or diagonal on a European root (the list above), calls and puts alike, is refused with `max_loss_unknown` whatever its strikes. The bound needs the long to be worth at least the short's payoff when the short expires, and a European long cannot be exercised to get it: a European put is worth its strike discounted, a deep in-the-money European call is worth less than its intrinsic value once the dividends before its expiry outweigh the interest on the strike, and VIX and VIXW expiries each settle on a different VIX futures month, so a later VIX call can be worth far less than an expiring one. A short expiring after its long, or a calendar with more legs, is refused with `max_loss_unknown`. A close is never checked against it.

**Known limitation: early assignment.** The bound does not cover early assignment of a short American call before an ex-dividend date. If the short leg of a call spread, butterfly, condor or calendar is assigned early, the account is short shares (and owes the dividend) until the long leg is exercised or sold, and a calendar's long may be worth less than the shares it must cover. None of this is in the maximum loss.

**Closes and pending legs.** A close is refused with `not_sent{reason: "leg_pending"}`, and `detail.symbols` lists each leg that has a pending order, while any order the gateway holds on that leg's symbol (the same symbol key as in section 6) is still open or unresolved: an admitted, sent or unknown order, an absent order that is not yet settled, or any working order in a non-terminal state. The whole intent is refused. Closes on legs with no such order are unchanged, and no open-order or daily cap applies to them. Opens are not refused by this rule; they count pending orders against `--max-open`.

A cleared order (section 5, item 6) is not open, so it neither blocks a close on its legs nor counts toward `--max-open`.

The day count is rebuilt from the journal on restart, and only a journaled submit with an opening leg counts toward it. A journaled intent that cannot be read counts as opening, so the count fails closed.

## 9. Safety rules

| Rule | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Paper/live isolation | Endpoints are compiled constants selected by `--environment`. A paper process cannot build a live URL (enforced by the type system), and tests inject transports instead of overriding URLs. Live trading needs `--broker alpaca-live --allow-live`, and its own process, caps and clients. |
| Start gate | The process starts `reconciling` and becomes `ready` only when: the account is active and not blocked; `options_trading_level` ≥ the profile minimum (3); the journal chain verifies; and broker reconciliation ([section 11](#11-order-journal)) is complete. Until then a submit is `not_sent{not_ready}`. Foreign orders or non-option positions are reported as `foreign` events; they do not block unless the profile says so. |
| Flatten | An admin's `flatten` closes everything: it sets `kill{halt_opens}` (unless `halt_all` is already set), cancels every open order as `halt_all` does, then asks the broker to close every position at market in **one request that is never resent**. Alpaca: `DELETE /v2/positions?cancel_orders=true`, which places a market order per position; the response lists each position's `{symbol, status, broker_raw}` (its closing order, or why not). An `unknown` outcome means the request may have reached the broker: look at `positions` before asking again. The closing orders are the broker's, so they arrive as `foreign` order events, with their fills. Options close at market, across whatever spread there is. Opens stay refused until `unkill`. The request and its outcome are journaled as `flatten` events (phase `requested` / `outcome`), visible to the requesting admin and to observers. The simulated broker closes each position at its touch (else the scripted quote's mid, else its average cost). |
| Clearing | Only an admin's `clear_order`, or the session-order rule for `day` and `cls` orders, and only when both broker checks show nothing for the order ([section 5](#5-requests-and-responses), item 6). A clear never resends and never closes anything; it stops the order counting as open, and its client id stays reserved. |
| Kill switch | `kill{halt_opens}` refuses any submit with an opening leg. `kill{halt_all}` refuses every submit and cancels every open order: first `DELETE /v2/orders`, then a check of each order. The default level is `halt_all`. Triggers: an admin request, the CLI through the admin role, or a `KILL` sentinel file in the state root. The kill state is journaled and **persists across restarts**; only an explicit `unkill` clears it. |
| Broker stream down | If `trade_updates` has been down for more than 5 s, the state becomes `degraded` and submits are `not_sent{not_ready}`. Cancels are still allowed. While down, the gateway polls open orders at 1 Hz. On reconnect the state returns to `ready` at once, and the REST resync ([section 11](#11-order-journal)) runs after it, one call per poll. Submits are accepted during the resync. Orders the stream missed still count toward `--max-open` and block closes on their legs until the resync or a lookup settles them, so a stale open order makes the caps stricter, never looser. |
| Client disconnect | **No automatic cancel.** A client can opt in with `hello.cancel_on_disconnect: true`: after a 2 s grace period, its open orders (by prefix) are cancelled, one cancel per tick in a stable (sorted) order, so a client with many orders is cancelled over several ticks. Targets are dropped if the client reconnects first. A gateway restart leaves broker orders alone and reconciles them. |
| Expiry day | No gateway cutoff: an opening leg on a contract that expires today goes to the broker like any other, and the broker's own expiry-day rules decide (a rejection comes back as `rejected` with its reason). Client policy, such as a strategy's own cutoff before the close, stays in the client. (Earlier builds refused these as `not_sent{cutoff}`.) |
| Index options | Not in the v1 allowlist, but the code does not enforce this: no check refuses an index root. Whether index options can be traded is decided by the operator's `--underlyings` list and by `any_underlying_clients` (`--any-underlying-client`), which skips the underlying check for its client. A European index root must also be in `EUROPEAN_ROOTS` (section 8); an unlisted root is treated as American. |

## 10. Simulated broker

`SimBroker` implements the same `Broker` seam and the same protocol. A client cannot tell it apart except through `welcome.broker = "sim"` and `pins`. The simulator is a broker: its simulated cash, positions and activities are broker state, not a client's portfolio.

### Scripted mode (`--sim-script FILE`)

This mode is for tests and needs no market data. The script is JSON and contains rules. Each rule matches the nth submit or a `client_order_id`, and gives:
- `submit`: one of `accept`, `reject{http, code, message}`, `fill`, `partial{n}`, `error_before_send`, `timeout_after_accept` or `http_429{headers}`
- `cancel`: one of `ok`, `ignore` or `reject`
- `fill_on_query`
- per-leg `skew` (unequal leg fills)
- a stream `drop{after_events}`, which exercises resync

The script also sets the account fields (status, options level, cash, blocked flags) and any foreign positions and orders. The simulator counts the sends it receives, so tests can assert that the gateway never resent.

### Market mode (`--sim-quotes SOURCE`)

**Sources.** A source is an uncompressed DBN file (decompress a store's `.dbn.zst` first), a DBN stream that needs no request (`tcp:HOST:PORT`, such as `replay dbn --listen`), a market data relay, joined live with `tinytrader.relay/1` (`relay:HOST:PORT`), or, in process, a session ([decision 0022](../decisions/0022-sessions.md)) that pushes records through a `Feed` (`SimBroker::fed`) each with its time in the session's order. Records are `cmbp-1`, `tcbbo`, `cbbo-*`, `bbo-*` or `mbp-1` (their top of book), with definitions or symbol mappings (a batch file's `SymbolMappingMsg`, whose `stype_out_symbol` is the raw symbol); the instrument is keyed by `raw_symbol` with spaces removed. A `tcbbo` record carries the quote before its trade: it is an instrument's book only where no other quote record (`cmbp-1`, `cbbo-*`, `bbo-*`, `mbp-1`) has given that instrument one, since beside them it would put back a quote the trade may have consumed. A minute schema (`cbbo-1m`, `bbo-1m`) changes the book only on minute boundaries, so an order fills on those against a book up to a minute old. In file and relay sources a record is timed by its own field (`ts_recv`, `ts_event` for `mbp-1`); fed by a session, by the time the session's merge gives it (decision 0009: `ts_recv`, or `ts_event` plus the source's declared offset where `F_BAD_TS_RECV` is set).

**Book state.** For each instrument the simulator keeps the last bid and ask price and size from `levels[0]`. Rules:
- `UNDEF_PRICE` makes that side absent.
- A crossed quote (bid > ask) makes the instrument **unusable** until a non-crossed quote arrives. A locked quote (bid = ask) is usable.

**Market time.** `t_mkt` is the largest authoritative timestamp seen so far: `ts_recv` for OPRA, `ts_event` for Alpaca. It never decreases. The simulator never reads the wall clock in replay; `ts_gateway` equals `t_mkt` in replay.

**Client-clocked replay.** This is the mode that guarantees determinism.
- The simulator applies quote records only up to the most recent `advance{to_ts}` from the client.
- A request is stamped with the `t_mkt` at the moment it is processed.
- With a live relay source, the simulator advances as records arrive. That mode is **not** reproducible, and `pins` says so.
- **Clocked by a session.** A session hosting the gateway in process advances it through `Gateway::clock()`, not a client connection: `Clock::advance(client, orders, to_ts, wait)` waits until the client's **order messages** handled reach `orders`, then advances. Order messages are `submit` and `cancel` requests, valid or not, counted from the client's first connection; queries and heartbeats don't count. This is the gateway half of decision 0022's `ready{sent}`: an order the strategy sent before its `ready` is always stamped before the clock moves, however threads interleave. A wait still short of its count after `wait` is dropped and answered with an error, so it never holds up the advances behind it and never runs late; one whose count is met runs, whatever the time. The count is per client and never resets: after a reconnect and resume, the client's `sent` keeps counting from where it was, resent orders included (request ids are per connection; this count isn't). A line the gateway can't read at all (`line_too_long`, bad JSON) closes the connection and isn't counted, so a wait for it ends in the error, not a hang. A client's own `advance` is refused with `clocked_by_session`. The session pushes every record up to `to_ts` before advancing to it, in order (a record earlier than one pushed before, or at a time the simulator has already been advanced to, is refused), so the simulator never waits on its feed.

**Latency.** An order activates at `t_act = t_submit + strategy_latency + submit_latency + jitter`. A cancel takes effect at `t_cancel + strategy_latency + cancel_latency + jitter`.
- **`report_latency_ms`** (0 by default): a report (an order event, an activity) happens at its time, and its stamps say so, but reaches the client's stream only once the market time has passed that time plus this latency. Queries (`account`, `positions`, `order`, `open_orders`, `orders_since`, `activities`) answer at once from the venue's state by default, as a broker's REST runs ahead of its stream; a gateway's REST reconciliation can then report an order's status before the stream reports the fill, so the client sees the status event (without the fill's details) and later the stream's fill event.
- **`report_latency_applies_to`** (`"stream"` by default, or `"all"`): under `"all"` queries answer from the account as of the last released report, so a strategy that polls is tested as conservatively as one that listens.
- **`latency_jitter_ms = {"min", "max"}`** (none by default): each activation and each cancel adds a delay drawn uniformly from `[min, max]` ms. Each draw comes from the profile's `seed` and the venue's admission number of the submit or cancel, so the same seed and the same requests give the same delays, whatever ids the strategy picks. Submits sent on several connections within one step are admitted in arrival order, so a deterministic strategy sends its orders on one connection.
- While the stream is down, reports wait with the delayed ones and go out in time order when it returns.
- A scripted (unfed) simulator records these settings in its pin and ignores them. A session gives each venue its own seed, derived from the run's `seed` and the venue's name.

All three are in the pin with the seed. From `tinytrader-sim/6`, runs with settlement or a liquidation also hash differently from `/5`: their activities are in the session's audit. `latency_ms` (5 ms by default) is the venue's; `strategy_latency_ms` (0 by default) is the strategy's declared latency, set by the session that clocks the simulator (decision 0022, section 2). Both are constants in the pin, at most an hour each. Scripted mode pins `strategy_latency_ms` but has no clock for it to delay.

**Queue model** (`queue = {"ahead", "fill_on_print"}`, off by default). With trade prints (`tcbbo`), a limit order resting behind the touch fills only once the trading ahead of it has happened:
- A marketable order still fills at the touch. An order that rests joins a queue on each leg, at its price: a single's limit; a combo leg's implied price, the net limit split over the legs in proportion to their mids. Ahead of it is `ahead` (a fraction, `"1"` by default) of the size displayed on its side when it joins, if its price is at or behind the touch, and nothing if it is inside the spread. It keeps its place if the book moves.
- A print through a leg's price (below a buy's, above a sell's) clears the leg. A print at its price (within half a cent) clears it once the prints' sizes have used up the queue ahead, unless `fill_on_print = "through"`, under which only prints through count.
- A single fills its remaining quantity at its limit when its leg clears. A combo fills, each leg at its implied price, when every leg has cleared within the same minute; a leg cleared in an earlier minute must clear again.
- Each leg's price, size ahead and minute cleared are in the order's `broker_raw.order.queue`, on its events and queries.
- Not modelled: market impact, partial fills from prints smaller than the order, and orders joining the queue behind this one.

The settings are in the pin.

**Fill model.**
- *When an order may fill:* with `fill_on = "book"` (the default), an order is evaluated against the book standing when it activates, then after each instant that touches it. With `fill_on = "next_quote"`, it waits for the first quote after it activates. That suits bar data (`cbbo-1m`): a bar's quotes are what the strategy decided on, already in the past when the order arrives, so the fill comes from the next bar.
- *Single buy limit L:* fillable when the ask is present and ask ≤ L. It fills at the **ask**, which is the price improvement up to the touch.
- *Single sell:* fillable when the bid is present and bid ≥ L, at the bid.
- *Combo:* the net cost per unit is
  `N = Σ_buy ratio·ask − Σ_sell ratio·bid`
  over the current state of every leg. Every needed side must be present and every leg usable. The combo is fillable when N ≤ `limit_price`; this one rule covers both debits and credits, because credits are negative. It fills **atomically**, with each leg at its touch and the parent `fill.price = N`. A market order is fillable whenever every needed side is present (in scripted mode it fills at its `ref_price`).
- *Quantity:* the default is atomic full quantity. With `size_cap: displayed`, the fill is min(remaining, displayed size) for a single, or min over legs of ⌊size / ratio⌋ for a combo. The rest stays working. A displayed size, once consumed, is not consumed again until a new quote record arrives for that instrument.
- *Expiry:* working `day` orders expire at the session close in the profile calendar, with an early close where the calendar lists one.
- *Fees:* each fill carries `fees` from the fee profile: `fee_per_contract` on option legs (default $0.02) and `fee_per_share` on stock legs (default $0). It is in dollars for the fill, never folded into its price.

**Rejects.**
- An instrument with no definition seen gets `rejected{code:"sim_unknown_instrument"}`.
- An option past its expiry date (New York) gets `rejected{code:"sim_expired_instrument"}`, and nothing fills against an expired contract.

- A client's `advance` to a simulator a session clocks gets `request_error{code:"clocked_by_session"}`.
- A submit outside the session gets `rejected{code:"sim_market_closed"}`. This is a v1 simplification; Alpaca queues day orders submitted outside the session.

**Instrument ids change daily, and books don't carry over.** OPRA assigns ids per day, so an id can name another contract tomorrow. A definition or mapping that gives an id to a new symbol makes the simulator forget the symbol it named before, quote included. A symbol given a new id loses the old id's quote. On the first market time of a day past an option's expiry, the contract and its book are forgotten. A contract not mapped on a later day therefore has no book (`sim_unknown_instrument`), never yesterday's quote. An expired contract's position is settled at its expiry's close, as below. At the first market time of each new New York day every quote is cleared (mappings stay), so an order at the open fills only on that day's first quote, never on yesterday's book.

**Deterministic ordering rules.**
1. Quote records are applied in input order. Records with equal timestamps keep their input order and together form the book of that instant: working orders are evaluated once all of them are applied, and an instrument's last quote in the instant is its book. So a combo never fills on some legs' new quotes against others' old ones, nor on a quote replaced within the same instant.
2. An order action (activation or cancel effect) at time `t` is applied **after** every quote record with `ts ≤ t` and before any record with `ts > t`.
3. On activation, an order is evaluated against the book as of `t_act`. After that it is re-evaluated after each instant whose quote records touch one of its legs (rule 1).
4. When several working orders are fillable on the same record, they are evaluated in order of (`t_act`, admission `seq`). Under `size_cap: displayed` they consume the displayed size in that order.
5. If a fill and a cancel take effect at the same time, the fill wins, because the cancel effect waits for rule 2. A cancel response is `accepted` whenever the order is open when the request arrives. The terminal event is `canceled`, or `fill` if a fill came first.

**Reproducibility pin.** `pins` contains:
- the quote source and its manifest sha256 or relay stream id
- the simulator model version (`tinytrader-sim/7`; `/7` adds the queue model; `/6` adds report latency and seeded jitter; `/5` adds the venue rules; `/4` settles expiries and charges stock its own fee; `/2` brought definitions from symbol mappings, `cbbo`, `bbo` and `tcbbo` books, one book per instant and the strategy's latency; `/3` forgets expired contracts and reused instrument ids)
- the latencies
- the fee profile
- `size_cap`
- the calendar
- the script sha256

The same pin and the same request sequence produce a **byte-identical event transcript**.

**Expiry, settlement and assignment** (market mode). At each session's close, after every record and order action at or before it, options expiring that day are settled as a broker would. Each result is an account activity, delivered as an `activity` event (section 7):
- **Cash-settled roots** pay intrinsic value in cash: `OPEXC` for a long in the money, `OPASN` for a short, `OPEXP` out of the money.
  - `cash-am` roots (SPX, NDX, RUT, VIX, DJX) settle against the AM special opening quotation.
  - `cash-pm` roots (SPXW, XSP, NDXP, RUTW, VIXW, …) settle against the PM close.
- **Every other root is physically settled.** A long call or short put in the money by at least `exercise_threshold` ($0.01) buys 100 shares per contract at the strike; a long put or short call sells them. Anything less expires (`OPEXP`).
- **Settlement prices** come from `expiry.settlement_file`, a CSV of `root, date, kind (AM-SOQ | PM-close), value` pinned by SHA-256. It is read strictly: every row needs all four fields with a YYYY-MM-DD date and a known kind, and a row repeated for its root, date and kind is refused. Where `settle_from_quote` allows (the default), a physically settled root may instead use the venue's own quote of the underlying, its mid, if that quote is from within `quote_max_age_s` (60 s) of the close. A price that can't be had fails the advance with the reason, so a session ends the run incomplete. It is never guessed, and nothing of that close's settlements is applied.
- **All or nothing.** A close's settlements and early assignments are all worked out, every price included, before any position, cash or share changes. Then their activities are sent; ones held back while the stream is down are sent when it returns.
- **Last trading day.** An AM-settled root's options stop trading the session before their expiry date, whose morning gives the settlement value. From then on they're refused (`sim_expired_instrument`), never filled, and their book is dropped. VIX and VIXW settle that way too, on a Wednesday. Every other option trades through its expiry date's close.
- **Early assignment** is opt-in (`early_assignment`). At the close of the day before an ex-dividend date, from `expiry.dividends` (root → CSV with `ex_date`, `dividend_usd`, read strictly), a physically settled short call in the money is assigned when its bid less its intrinsic value is below the dividend. When `put_assignment_extrinsic` is set, at any close a short put in the money is assigned when that is below it. Prices are looked up only where a rule applies, the option's bid only if fresh (within `quote_max_age_s`); without a fresh bid it isn't assigned.
- **Contract size.** Settlement assumes 100 shares per contract. The gateway refuses non-standard (adjusted) OCC symbols, so no other deliverable reaches the simulator.
- **Not modelled:** pin risk (a holder's choice not to exercise near the threshold) and assignment beyond these rules.
- `expiry.settle = false` turns all of this off, for runs that hold nothing to expiry or quote no underlying.

```json
{"fee_per_contract": "0.65", "fee_per_share": "0",
 "expiry": {"styles": {"XSP": "cash-am"}, "settlement_file": "/path/settlements.csv", "settle_from_quote": true,
            "exercise_threshold": "0.01", "early_assignment": true, "dividends": {"SPY": "/path/SPY.csv"},
            "put_assignment_extrinsic": "0.01", "quote_max_age_s": 60}}
```

**Venue rules** (`venue_rules`), each off unless set, as a broker applies them:
- **`no_same_day_opening_after = "15:30"`.** After this New York time, an order opening an option on its last trading day is refused (`sim_same_day_opening`). That's Alpaca's rule.
- **`liquidate_same_day_shorts_at = "15:45"`.** At this time, every short option position on its last trading day, in a physically settled root, is bought back at its ask as a broker order. Working orders on it are canceled first. The account's clients see the broker order as a `foreign` event and its fill as a `FILL` activity. Live, Alpaca pushes no activities, so a live strategy learns of a liquidation from positions; the simulator tells it more. A short with no ask stays, to settle at the close. That's Alpaca's rule for accounts that can't cover exercise or assignment; the long wings stay.
- **`buying_power = "defined_risk"`.** An opening order is refused (`sim_insufficient_buying_power`), never resized, when cash, less the order's premium, less the worst loss at expiry of each expiry's option positions with the order filled, would be negative. A position whose loss has no bound (more short calls than long in an expiry) is refused outright. `account` reports that buying power. It approximates a broker's options buying power for defined-risk spreads; margin on naked positions isn't modelled.

```json
{"venue_rules": {"no_same_day_opening_after": "15:30", "liquidate_same_day_shorts_at": "15:45", "buying_power": "defined_risk"}}
```

**Deferred:** queue and L2 models, and stochastic latency. Each one changes the pin, not the protocol.

## 11. Order journal

The journal is the minimal correlation state the gateway needs. It serves four needs:
- idempotency across restarts
- lossless client resume
- reconciliation after a restart
- audit evidence

It is **not** an order book and not a source of truth for order state; the broker is. Its format is `tinytrader.gateway-journal/1`.

### Layout

```text
<state-root>/                        e.g. /var/lib/order-gateway/paper-a/
  lock                               exclusive flock; a second process refuses to start
  KILL                               optional operator sentinel
  journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl         one file per UTC day, append-only
```

The state root is durable: never under `/tmp` (or a `--forbid-state-under` directory), never deleted recursively; tests use disposable roots.

### Line grammar

Each line is the complete wire event ([section 7](#7-events)), including `schema` and `type`, with `prev` appended as its last field:

```json
{"schema":"tinytrader.gateway/1","type":"event","seq":1302,"ts_gateway":1791221400123456789,"account":"paper-a","kind":"order", …, "prev":"9f2c…(64 hex)"}
```

- `prev` is the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the complete previous line's bytes, including its `\n`.
- The account's first line uses 64 zeros.
- The first line of each later day is `kind:"day"`, carrying `format:"tinytrader.gateway-journal/1"`, the previous file name and its last line's hash. Its `prev` is that hash, so the chain crosses days.
- The line's bytes are exactly the event bytes sent to clients plus the trailing `prev` field. Clients receive the line without `prev`.

### Write rule

Each line is written and fsync'd (`F_FULLFSYNC` on macOS) **before** the side effect or delivery it announces:
- `submit{phase:"sent"}` is fsync'd before the HTTP bytes leave.
- Every event is fsync'd before it is queued to any client.

Creating a new file also fsyncs the directory.

### Recovery at start

1. Take the lock.
2. Read the files in order. A torn final line, with no `\n`, is truncated; this is the only repair allowed.
3. Verify the hash chain and the `seq` continuity. A mismatch anywhere else is fatal: the process refuses to start and leaves the files untouched.
4. Rebuild the map `client_order_id → last known state, intent_sha256` and the reserved-id set from the last 30 days. A `cleared` line marks its order cleared; a `clear_refused` line changes nothing.
5. Enter `reconciling`.
   - Fetch every order that is non-terminal or `unknown` by its client id.
   - Then `GET /v2/orders?status=all&after=<last event ts − 60 s>&nested=true`, plus `FILL` activities since then.
6. Emit `order` events with `source: rest_reconcile` for every state change not yet journaled, then `status{resync}`, then `ready`.

The same resync runs after every `trade_updates` reconnect, with two differences: the state is already `ready` while it runs (section 9, *Broker stream down*), and a failed account gate drops it rather than holding it (section 8, *Broker calls per tick*). An order in phase `sent` without an outcome is treated exactly like `unknown`: the gateway looks it up and never resends it.

### Retention

- Every day stays on disk. The gateway never deletes journal files; the volume is a few KB per day.
- The resume window is the current UTC day plus the previous trading day. Older resumes get `resume: truncated`.
- Ids are reserved for 30 days.
- Shipping sealed days to an archive is deferred.

## 12. Error codes

**Connection errors** (`type:"error"`, then the connection closes):

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `bad_json`, `line_too_long` | Framing error |
| `hello_required`, `hello_timeout` | The first line was not `hello`, or did not arrive within 5 s |
| `schema_unsupported` | Unknown `schema` |
| `unauthorized` | Bad token, or a client not bound to this account |
| `slow_consumer` | The outbound queue overflowed. Resume to recover. |
| `idle_timeout` | Peer silent for 30 s |
| `shutting_down` | The process is stopping |

**Request errors** (`response.outcome:"error"`; the connection stays open):

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `invalid_request` | Unknown type or field, or a wrong JSON type, with `detail.path` |
| `duplicate_request_id` | Reused within the connection |
| `forbidden` | Outside the client's role or prefix (`kill`, `unkill`, `flatten` and `clear_order` need the admin role) |
| `not_found` | `cancel` target unknown to the journal and the broker |
| `broker_error` | A query failed, with `http_status`, `code` and `message` |
| `throttled`, `not_ready` | A query was refused by the budget or the state |
| `unsupported` | The operation is not available for this broker kind |

**`not_sent.reason`** for `submit` and `cancel`:
- `validation` (with `detail.path`)
- `unsupported`
- `prefix`
- `cap` (with `detail.cap`)
- `max_loss_unbounded` (with `detail.symbols`): an opening naked short call or short share
- `max_loss_unknown` (with `detail.symbols`): an opening intent whose maximum loss the gateway cannot bound
- `market_opening_refused`: a market buy-to-open or sell-to-open, option or stock, for any client. Its reference price does not bound the fill, so no cap can hold it. Use a limit. A market close is not refused.
- `killed`
- `not_ready`
- `leg_pending` (with `detail.symbols`: a close on a leg that has an open or unresolved order)
- `close_exceeds_position` (with `detail.symbol`, `requested_qty`, `held_qty`: a close larger than the position held, including a close of a flat symbol)
- `position_unknown` (with `detail.symbol`, `requested_qty`, `code`: the position read failed, so the close is refused)
- `throttled`
- `duplicate_conflict`

**`not_cleared.reason`** for `clear_order` ([section 5](#5-requests-and-responses), item 6):
- `unknown_order`: the gateway holds no order with that client id.
- `not_unresolved`: the order is settled, so there is nothing to clear.
- `broker_shows_order` (with `detail.check` and `detail.status`): the broker has the order in that state. `check` is `open_orders` or `by_id`.
- `broker_unreachable` (with `detail.check` and `detail.code`): a broker check failed (an error, a timeout or the budget) and neither check showed the order. `code: listing_full` means the open orders listing had 500 entries and did not show the order, so it may have been cut short.

## 13. Worked examples

These follow the two Alpaca shapes. Lines are wrapped here for reading; on the wire each one is a single line.

**Hello, with resume:**

```json
{"schema":"tinytrader.gateway/1","type":"hello","client":"my-strategy","token":"<redacted>","resume_after_seq":1288}

```

**A single limit that opens and then fills.** The Alpaca body sent is `{"symbol":"SPY261005C00580000","qty":"1","side":"buy","type":"limit","limit_price":"1.25","time_in_force":"day","client_order_id":"strat-20261005-0001","position_intent":"buy_to_open"}`.

```

**A two-leg MLEG credit spread, partly filled and then cancelled.** The Alpaca body is `{"order_class":"mleg","qty":"3","type":"limit","limit_price":"-0.40","time_in_force":"day","client_order_id":"strat-20261005-0002","legs":[{"symbol":"SPY261005P00570000","ratio_qty":"1","side":"sell","position_intent":"sell_to_open"},{"symbol":"SPY261005P00568000","ratio_qty":"1","side":"buy","position_intent":"buy_to_open"}]}`.

```

**Unknown, then resolved.** The POST times out after the bytes were sent. The gateway does not send a second POST.

```json
{"schema":"tinytrader.gateway/1","type":"response","request_id":"r-20","op":"submit","outcome":"unknown","reason":"timeout",
 "client_order_id":"strat-20261005-0003"}

 "event":"new","status":"new","source":"rest_reconcile",…}
```

**Refusals before any I/O:**

```json
{"schema":"tinytrader.gateway/1","type":"response","request_id":"r-21","op":"submit","outcome":"not_sent","reason":"killed",
 "detail":{"level":"halt_opens"}}
{"schema":"tinytrader.gateway/1","type":"response","request_id":"r-22","op":"submit","outcome":"duplicate",

```

## Running `order-gateway`

```text
order-gateway --account sim-1 --broker sim --listen 127.0.0.1:7601 --state /var/lib/order-gateway/sim-1 \
  --client my-strategy,trade,strat-,/etc/tinytrader/gateway-clients/my-strategy.token \

```

- Exit codes: 0 after SIGINT/SIGTERM (clients receive `shutting_down`), 1 for a runtime failure (lock held, journal chain broken, bind failure), 2 for usage (including a non-loopback `--listen`, a state root under `/tmp` or a `--forbid-state-under` directory, or a token file that is not mode 600 or is a symlink).
- The process needs no feed, relay, replay or data-gateway process. Market mode reads only the quote source it is given.
- To stop new orders without a client, create `<state>/KILL`; the gateway enters `halt_all` within a second. Only an admin `unkill` clears it, and the sentinel must be removed first.
- `--sim-script` is JSON. Every key is optional: `clock_ts` (a fixed clock moved only by `advance`; omitted means the wall clock), `calendar` (omitted: weekdays 09:30 to 16:00 ET; `null`: none, so session checks fail closed; or a list of `{date, open, close}`), `account` (`status`, `options_trading_level`, `cash`, `blocked`), `positions`, `orders` (preloaded broker orders), `quotes` (scripted fill prices), `default` and `rules` (each matching `nth` or `client_order_id`, with `submit`, `cancel`, `fill_on_query` and `skew`), `stream` (`drop_after_events`, `down_ms`), `fee_per_contract`, `latency_ms`, `strategy_latency_ms` and `size_cap`.
- `--broker alpaca-paper --credentials env` serves one Alpaca paper account with keys from `APCA_API_KEY_ID` and `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` (or their `*_FILE` forms), as a secrets manager or container secrets provide. `--credentials-file FILE` serves one from a file. The file is mode 600, a regular file, not a symlink, and holds `APCA_API_KEY_ID`/`APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` (or the `ALPACA_*` spellings); values are never printed. The endpoints are compiled in (`paper-api.alpaca.markets`); there is no URL option. `--sim-*` options are refused with it.
- `--broker alpaca-live --allow-live --credentials env` serves the live account (real money) on `api.alpaca.markets`, the one live host compiled in (`trading.rs`, checked by a test). Give a live gateway small caps and few clients; whether to run one is the deployment's decision. Without `--allow-live`, `alpaca-live` is refused; `--allow-live` with any other broker is refused too.
- `--sim-quotes` takes a DBN v1/v3 file, a `tcp:` stream such as `replay dbn --listen`, or `relay:HOST:PORT`, a relay's stream (live, so not reproducible). Definitions, symbol mappings and the top of book of `cmbp-1`, `tcbbo`, `cbbo-*`, `bbo-*` and `mbp-1` are read; other records are skipped. Market time starts at the first record and moves only with `advance`.

## Simulated stock orders

The simulated broker fills a stock leg like an option leg, at ×1: in market mode against `mbp-1` quotes for the stock. It does not model the closing auction, so a `cls` order there behaves as a `day` limit order.

## Remaining work

- **Paper qualification** on a paper account: a single far from the market cancelled; a 2-leg spread cancelled; a 1-share limit-on-close round trip; `halt_all` with a resting order; a restart while an order rests (reconciliation, no resend); capture of the MLEG fill shape.
- **Observe endpoints:** `/health`, `/metrics` and `/describe` like every other service ([decision 0017](../decisions/0017-client-contracts.md)).
