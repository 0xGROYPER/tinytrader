//! Databento batch jobs: price a request, submit it, follow it, and download
//! the finished files into the store.
//!
//! - `GET /jobs`: Databento's jobs (not expired), each with what the store
//!   already holds of it and any download in progress.
//! - `GET /datasets`, `GET /schemas?dataset=`: for the request form.
//! - `POST /price` with `{ dataset, schema, symbol, stype_in?, start, end,
//!   rule? | contracts?, hours?, again? }` (dates, `end` inclusive): prices
//!   only what's missing (see `plan`): the store's holdings, Databento's jobs
//!   and the ledger's purchases are subtracted per day, contract and window.
//!   The quote lists each request (the whole symbol over a run of days, or a
//!   day's missing contracts over the hours they need), what was skipped and
//!   why. Long prices answer `pricing` (202); `GET /quotes/{id}` follows.
//! - `GET /quotes`, `GET /quotes/{id}`: quotes still good, in full.
//!   `DELETE /quotes/{id}` declines one (with the approval token).
//! - `POST /submit` with `{ quote, confirm_usd, again?, approved_by? }`:
//!   plans the quote again under the purchase lock (one purchase at a time)
//!   and submits its requests only if they and the total are unchanged. A
//!   paid one needs a person's approval: the console's bearer token
//!   (`JOBS_APPROVE_TOKEN` or `_FILE`), who approved it, and `confirm_usd`
//!   exactly the price; the ledger records the approval before anything is
//!   sent. Never what's had already, and nothing while any of that can't be
//!   read in full. A purchase in the ledger whose job is expired or no longer
//!   listed is bought again only when the quote's `again` names its job. A
//!   submission is never retried; if its outcome is uncertain it blocks until
//!   found on the job list or resolved with `POST /ledger/resolve`.
//! - `GET /ledger/unresolved`: the submissions whose outcome isn't known,
//!   each with the `request` and `at` that resolving it names.
//! - `POST /ledger/resolve` with `{ request, at, job, note }`: the operator's
//!   word on a submission whose outcome isn't known.
//! - `POST /download/{job}`: streams the job's files into the store, each
//!   checked against Databento's size and SHA-256, then has the store file
//!   the batch. Jobs submitted here download by themselves once done.
//!   Downloading an already purchased job never charges again.
//! - `POST /cache/{job}` / `DELETE /cache/{job}`: a checked copy of a done
//!   job's files in `JOBS_CACHE_DIR`, outside the store, and its removal.
//!
//! The API key comes from `DATABENTO_API_KEY` or `DATABENTO_API_KEY_FILE`.
//! The store's write token, when the store requires one, from
//! `JOBS_STORE_TOKEN` or `JOBS_STORE_TOKEN_FILE`: sent, as a bearer token, on
//! the uploads and filing only, never to Databento.
