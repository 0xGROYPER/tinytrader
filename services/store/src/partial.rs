//! Partial days (decision 0018): a day file that holds a list of contracts
//! for part of the day, not a provider's whole parent symbol.
//!
//! - **Coverage.** A file's contracts and time window come from its own DBN
//!   header (`stype_in = raw_symbol`, its symbols, start and end), checked
//!   against every record: each must map to a listed contract and fall inside
//!   the window. A partial day's coverage is pieces, one per file that went
//!   into it (pieces of the same window combined), recorded in its manifest
//!   entry (see the manifest module) beside the file's size and SHA-256. A day
//!   with no coverage there is complete (every contract of the parent, as a
//!   parent-symbol batch delivers it), and so is one that comes to hold every
//!   contract of the day's definitions over the whole day.
//! - **Import.** DBN that didn't come from a provider batch (a timeseries
//!   request) is uploaded to `.incoming/<id>/` with an `import.json` naming
//!   the dataset, schema, parent symbol, where it came from, and each file's
//!   size and SHA-256. Filing is as for a batch: every check before any move,
//!   moves by link, a ledger in `migrations/`, receipts in `provenance/<id>/`.
//! - **Merge.** A partial day already held, given contracts (or hours of
//!   contracts) it doesn't hold, is replaced by the two merged in timestamp
//!   order, a record at a time: written beside it, read back and checked
//!   input by input, recorded as pending, swapped in by rename, then made
//!   current. An interrupted swap is settled from the file's hash by the next
//!   scan. Contracts are never filed twice for the same hours.
