//! A schema folder's manifest (decisions 0018 and 0019): what the store
//! records about its days beyond the files themselves.
//!
//! - `manifest.json` is a small index: one entry per day that has anything
//!   recorded. A complete day's entry (its condition, say) is kept there
//!   whole. A partial day's entry is a stub, `{ sidecar, partial: true,
//!   condition }`, and the day's full entry, with its coverage and every
//!   contract, is in `manifest.d/<day>.json`. Filing or merging a day rewrites
//!   that day's file, and the index only when its stub changes, so the cost
//!   doesn't grow with the days the folder holds. An index written before
//!   sidecars, with partial entries inline, is still read, and each such entry
//!   moves to its sidecar the first time the index is written.
//! - A merge in progress is `manifest.d/<day>.pending.json`: the entry the
//!   day will have once the merged file is in place. It is made current by
//!   renaming it over `<day>.json`, or dropped, by [`settle`].
//!
//! Every file is written whole: beside it, flushed, renamed over it, and the
//! folder flushed.
